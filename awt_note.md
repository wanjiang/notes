HTML5 is the development of that combination, the glue that holds
everything together. HTML5 proposes standards for every aspect of the Web as
well as a clear purpose for each technology involved. 

##HTML5 three basic features
- structure
- style
- functionality

###HTML5
- HTML5 is considered a product of the combination of HTML, CSS and Javascript.
  - HTML (markup language) is in charge of the structure, provides the structural elements
  - CSS (sheet of style) presents that structure and its content on the screen,
    manages the structure to make it attractive and useful
    - selector

    has the necessary power to provide functionality and build full 
    web applications.
    - Ajax is the name of group of techniques developed in Javascript
      that allow applications to get information form the server without
      refreshing the web page or loading a new document.

###Introduction to HTML
- The HyperText Markup Language is a programming language.
- It is not composed by commands or instruction but rather
  a set of tags that organize and declare a purpose for the 
  content of the document.
- The concept behind the creation of this language was the idea of
  sharing through the Internet not only the text included in the
  documents but also its format.

####HTML Tags
- meta
  - defines the character encoding of the document.
  - important for search engines and devices that need to preview 
    or get aa summary of the relevant data.
- title
- link
  - used to incorporate style, script, images or icons from external files
- head vs header
  - header is intended to provide introductory information,
    only to be used for the body or for sections within the body.
  - head providing information about the entire document
- nav
- section
- aside

####HTML Attributes
- Data-* 
- Reversed
- Ping and Download

#Browser engine

###CSS Model
####Box Models
Browsers consider every HTML element as a box,
A webpage is actually a group of boxes put together following certain rules
- Traditional Box Model
  - The boxes were created by expanding cells and combining rows of cells,
    columns of cells and entire tables.
  - It needs the boxes to be wrapped together to procide horizontal order.
- Flexible Box Model
  - The main purpose of a box model is to provide a mechanism for dividing
    the window's space into several boxes and creating the rows and columns
    that are part if a regular web design.
  - However, the Traditional Box Model fails in this regard.
  - The Flexible Box Model solves the Traditional Box Model's problems
    in an elegant manner.
  - In this model, the boxes finally represent those virtual rows and
    columns that are, in fact, what designers and users really see and
    care about.
  - the need to distribute the space in the window among the elements
    of the dicument. the elements had to be reduced or increased in size
    according to the space available.
    - flex containers
      - is an element that allows its content to be flexible.
      - declares two axes
        - the main axis
        - the cross axis
    - Justify-Content
      - the capacity to lay out free space
    - flex-wrap

####CSS3
- filter
  - add effect to an image
- transform
  - scale
  - rotate
  - skew
  - move or translate
- 3D transform
- transition
- animation


###Javascript
- is an interpreted language used for multiple purpose
- turn script into machine code in order to reach execution speeds similar to
  desktop app.
